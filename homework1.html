<h1 style=text-align:center>CNIT-132 Homework 1</h1> 
    <p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.
We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p><!-- I opened lots of new things like validator from W3C,understood how read errors/warnings  and how to correct them-->
    <p><img style="float:left;" src="oldboat.gif" alt="Old boat">The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?!<br>Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind!<br>Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account) together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!</p>
    <p>You will be able to change a little bit the content of the two paragraphs below to insert the links requested to make sense when reading the content.</p>
    <p>On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation, meaning the specification process is complete. So what is <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp target="_blank" rel="noopener">new in HTML5</a> ? </p><!-- target_blank tag opens this link in new window-->
    <p>If you want more information and practice with HTML5 you can take a class at City College of San Francisco. CCSF has couple levels of HTML class. How to find out which one is yours? Start with <a href ="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#subcontent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Student Counseling </a>. <!-- #subcontent after URL opens the page the Counseling page with the heading at the top of the browser-->
    <p>Include here below a horizontal ruler to divide the page:
    </p><hr><!-- <hr> for horizontal line-->
    <section><h2>Subtitle of our page</h2>
It's funny to see this page being upgraded. We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code and that's the idea of this exercise!<br>At least I am using one new HTML5 tag - the section tag. Not sure if I am using it correctly!
    </section>
<p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>
   
<ul>
<li>studying the target audience
<li>following standards when coding
<li>planning a web page</ul><!-- <ul></ul> here for unorder list-->
<p>Make sure you upload your file to Hills, inside the public_html folder, make sure also to upload the image of the oldboat but, especially for this work, make sure you validate your code!</body>
